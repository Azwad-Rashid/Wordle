Welcome to WORDLE by Azwad

I was bored one day and looking for inspiration about what to build next. That's when i suddenly got a notification, a friend asked if i completed that day's wordle.

That's when it struck me. I should try to make an implementation of Worldle using tkinter.

Why tkinter? I just happened to be learning tkinter at that moment. So it seemed to be a great opportunity to put my knowledge to the test and practice using the tools I'm learning about.
